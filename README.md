# Appointment Planner

[Deployed using surge](http://mjaappointmentplanner.surge.sh/)

In this project, I used functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 

The app consists of two pages:

- to view and add contacts
- to view and add appointments

> When you are typing in the phone number, make sure to use the correct phone number format xxx-xxx-xxxx
